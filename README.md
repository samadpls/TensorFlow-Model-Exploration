Welcome to my TensorFlow Machine Learning Projects repository! Here, I embark on an exciting journey through the realm of machine learning using TensorFlow, showcasing my work on captivating datasets like Titanic and Iris.

## Titanic Dataset - Exploring Linear Regression

In the Titanic dataset project, I delve into predicting continuous target variables using the powerful Linear Regression model. This venture provides an illuminating introduction to TensorFlow's application in regression tasks, covering data preprocessing, model construction, and comprehensive evaluations.

## Iris Dataset - Navigating Classification with TensorFlow

For the Iris dataset project, I tackle classification tasks using TensorFlow's versatility. I harness diverse classification techniques and explore Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architecture for classification. This project showcases TensorFlow's capabilities and highlights the process of building and training classification models.

## Onward to New Discoveries

My journey with TensorFlow and machine learning continues to unfold. I am excited to continue exploring various other techniques and approaches using TensorFlow. As I learn and experiment more, I will update this repository with new projects, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of machine learning concepts and TensorFlow's features.
